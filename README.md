# Jill


## About

Jill is an open source initiate to deliver a fast and lightweight
java-based BDI-like (Beliefs, Desires, Intentions) execution engine for 
developing large-scale multi-agent systems. Jill is:

* A BDI execution engine: that supports complex BDI goal-plan behaviour 
  hierarchies in the PRS style (A Rao and M Georgeff. BDI Agents: from 
  theory to practice. In ICMAS, volume 95, pages 312â€“319, 1995).

* Lightweight: the design and implementation is heavily optimised to 
  deliver a very lightweight distribution (see [Releases](#releases) for details)
  fit for inclusion in web-based and embedded-Java applications.

* Fast: The Jill BDI execution engine is very fast, and was designed from 
  ground-up to handle millions of BDI agents (see [Benchmarks](#benchmarks)). 

* Java-based: The programming of BDI agents in Jill is done in 
  pure Java, so users benefit from the various support tools that are available
  to Java developers, such as full integration with the Eclipse IDE.
  Jill itself is written in Java and is distributed as a JAR bundle which can
  be easily integrated into larger projects that require cognitive reasoning
  agents.

* Open source: Jill is released under the terms of the 
  GNU General Lesser Public License <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html>.
